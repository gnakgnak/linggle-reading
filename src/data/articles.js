    content: `WORLD'S SMALLEST VINEYARD MAKES ONLY 29 BOTTLES OF WINE A YEAR

At just under 20 square meters in size and a yearly yield of 29 bottles of wine, Via Mari 10 is considered the world's smallest vineyard.

Located on the rooftop of a 16th-century palace in the heart of Reggio Emilia, Via Mari 10 – named after its street and number – is not your average vineyard. Not only is it incredibly small in size; it also has an extremely tiny yearly yield of wine. However, the most peculiar thing about the Via Mari 10 wine is that you are not supposed to drink it.

The owner of the vineyard considers the 29 or so bottles of wine produced every year as works of art that should be collected and admired rather than consumed. That is kind of a problem, considering that you are paying €5,000 (USD$5,000) for a bottle of wine you are not even supposed to drink.

"My wine is a form of artistic expression, a philosophical statement, something to keep in your living room so you can chat about it with your friends and tell them about the lunatic who put a vineyard on his rooftop," Tulio Masoni, the owner of Via Mari 10, said. "If you see a bicycle wheel in a living room rather than in a repair shop, you realize how beautiful it is. My vineyard is like that. It is unexpected; it stimulates the brain; it sparks new thoughts."

Masoni started the unusual vineyard after selling a countryside vineyard he had inherited from his father. At the time, he thought operating a vineyard wouldn't make any financial sense, but he later regretted it, so he decided to start his own miniature vineyard on top of his house.

The grape vines that make up Via Mari 10 are fed with eggs, bananas, seaweed, and nightingale droppings, as well as city noise, which Masoni insists gives them an edge over countryside grape vines. However, that does not count for much, considering that you are not supposed to drink the wine.

"I'm the only wine producer in the world who says you shouldn't drink his wine," Masoni says.

Via Mari 10 wine bottles cannot be purchased at regular wine shops or even at the tiny vineyard itself. Instead, they are offered through the local Bonioni Art Gallery. If the cost sounds high for a bottle of wine, think of it as a rare artwork.

According to the Bonioni website, ten Via Mari 10 wine bottles are still available from its latest vintage (2019), with all previous yields being sold out. However, Masoni points out that not all of them were actually bought. Many were offered by the gallery as gifts to loyal clients.

And just in case you are curious what this incredibly exclusive red wine tastes like, Masoni claims that "at the first sip you get a lot of confusion, but after a few seconds something comes alive in your mouth that opens up your mind to a new dimension." But, since you are not supposed to drink the wine, you will just have to take his word for it.`,

    title: "RIGHT HAND UP",

    content: `INDIAN MAN HAS KEPT HIS RIGHT ARM RAISED FOR OVER A DECADE

An Indian monk has been holding his arm in an upward position continuously for more than a decade, in honor of his god.

Mahant Akhara, an Indian sadhu (a holy person who has renounced his worldly life) from Allahabad, has been keeping his right arm raised high above his head for more than 10 years in honor of a Hindu deity.

He was recently featured in a viral Twitter video, telling the interviewer that he wanted to do something so that his god will notice him. So, he raised his right arm up and never put it down again. Today, it is sort of stuck in that position, and he claims he does not even feel it anymore.

It turns out that the first couple of years are the most difficult. After that, the muscles in the arm become so wasted away that the whole limb becomes numb and stuck in that abnormal position. Mahant even pinches himself in the video to demonstrate that he doesn't feel anything anymore.

Asked how long he planned to keep his arm raised like that, Mahant, who even sleeps with his right arm in that unusual position, said that he had not even thought about it. He prefers to live in the present, but he expects to keep it raised for the rest of his life.

It is unclear exactly how long Mahant has been keeping his arm up like that; he just says, "Over 10 years" in the video, but there are photos of him on the Internet from 2018 with captions that claim he had been doing it for over a decade then. So, now, it has been at least 14 years.

If Mahant's sacrifice looks familiar, that is probably because he is not the first one ever to do it. Over a decade ago, another sadhu, who at the time had been holding his right arm up for 38 years, became a symbol for Shiva worshipers all over India. That sadhu has now been keeping his arm raised for almost half a century.`,

        MAN PADDLES MORE THAN 60 KM IN A PUMPKIN
    
Step aside, ultra-marathoners: the US has a new endurance athlete.

A Nebraska man has set a new world record after he paddled 38 miles (61.15 km) down a river in a huge, hollowed-out pumpkin that he grew himself.

Duane Hansen completed his journey last week, a Facebook post said.

Photographs on social media show Hansen crouched inside the giant vegetable, which weighed 384 kg.

Officials said Hansen set off down the Missouri River at about 7:30 am and completed his journey just after 6:30 pm.

It might look like fun — but you had better not try this at home. The 11-hour voyage appeared to take a physical toll on Hansen, who named the pumpkin boat Berta.

“I went 38 miles down the river in that pumpkin without standing up, and my knees still hurt,” Hansen said.

“I probably won't try this again,” he added with a smile. “If somebody breaks this record, I will bow down to him because he is tough.”

He told the Omaha World-Herald he had had to endure collisions with a sandbar and a rock as well as heavy rain and cold weather.

“I thought to myself, at the time: 'I'll just paddle harder and warm up.' I wasn't thinking about quitting,” he said. “I went another few miles, and it rained again. Berta has only about 8 inches [20 cm] above the water line. I’ve never paid so much attention to anything for so long in my entire life. It was tough.”

Hansen is described in the Facebook post as a “longtime Nebraska resident who enjoys growing large pumpkins, gourds and other vegetables as a hobby” who was inspired to beat the previous record after seeing another paddler attempt it.

“Seems like a unique, if slightly crazy, way to celebrate his 60th birthday, which was yesterday,” the post read.

Hansen asked city officials to bear witness to the feat so that it would be recognized by Guinness World Records.

That organization has not yet validated the results, but it predicted that it would beat the current record for “longest journey by pumpkin boat” held by Rick Swenson, who traveled 41.04 km in Grand Forks, North Dakota, in 2016.

Pumpkins are famed for their ability to reach extraordinary sizes, with some varieties weighing more than 900 kg.`,

    content: `GADGET FUNERAL-- PROFITS FROM PRESERVING OLD AND BROKEN GADGETS 

A unique “gadget funeral” service allows people to preserve outdated and broken devices that they have become attached to.

They say you should not get attached to material things, but most of us cannot really help it. Whether it is our first car, the house we grew up in, or even an old phone, we tend to get attached to our worldly possessions. And since mobile phones and tablets have become almost an extension of ourselves, it makes sense that some of us feel pain in upgrading, even when it is obvious that our old gadgets are not working well. That is where China's gadget funeral service business comes in, allowing users to preserve their obsolete devices as framed, deconstructed works of art that can be hung on the wall and admired forever.

Lin Xi, a woman from Weifang, in China's Shandong Province, started her lucrative gadget funeral business in 2019. She had studied in the UK and came into contact with the art of mounting electronic parts, which she found very interesting as a recycling concept. One day she asked herself, “Since I have so many old electronics around, why don’t I turn them into works of art?”

After practicing her skills with her own old tech, Lin started advertising her service online using the slogan: “Don't lose your used mobile phone; let me re-design it for you!” She posted a few examples of her work, and in just a few days, she had received over 200 orders via social media, which she struggled to fulfill for half a year.

At first, people came to Lin Xi with true electronic relics, like a first-generation Motorola mobile phone from 1970, a Nokia 3650, a rare Vertu phone worth 200,000 yuan, or the first mass-produced Android smartphone, the HTC G1. She honored them all, but as people learned about her service, more common smartphones started coming in.

Last year, a young man came to her with a 2014 handset that was no longer working but which he had become emotionally attached to. The memories tied to the old smartphone were apparently unforgettable, and he couldn’t simply throw it away. He asked Lin Xi to give the old gadget her special treatment so that he could keep it forever as a souvenir.

The so-called “gadget funeral” is essentially the art of dismantling and mounting. Technicians carefully take old or broken devices apart and rearrange their components onto framed canvases as a form of “cyber art.” The technical skill level for dismantling and mounting is very low, but whoever does it needs to have some kind of artistic taste and mountains of patience.

Lin Xi is just one of the hundreds, probably even thousands of entrepreneurs specializing in gadget funerals. 
Another such young artisan, Chen Xing-yi, said that he sometimes works from 8 am to 12 am at night, trying to complete orders, and he earns up to one million yuan (USD$140,000) per year.
Both Chen Xing-yi and Lin Xi feel as if they are helping clients preserve the memories tied to their obsolete or broken gadgets, and at the same time saving the environment. `,

Chinese metaverse company Fujian NetDragon Websoft recently made history by appointing an AI-powered virtual humanoid robot as its CEO.

The new AI-powered CEO, known as “Ms Tang Yu,” will also lead Fujian NetDragon Websoft’s “Organizational and Efficiency Department,” supervising operations at the technology company valued at almost USD$10 billion.

The board of NetDragon Websoft believes that artificial intelligence is the future of corporate management, and the appointment of Ms Tang Yu is a commitment to encourage the use of AI to change the way the company does business.

“Tang Yu will streamline business operations, enhance the quality of work, and improve overall efficiency,” a press release said. “Tang Yu will also serve as a real-time data hub and analytical tool to support rational decision-making in daily operations.”

“In addition, Tang Yu is expected to play a critical role in the development of employee talent and to ensure a fair and efficient workplace for all employees,” the press release added.

In the future, the Chinese tech company plans to expand the algorithms behind Tang Yu to create an honest, open management model, as NetDragon Websoft transforms into a “metaverse-based working community.”

Founded in 1999, NetDragon Websoft is one of China’s most respected video game developers, having worked on successful game titles including Eudemons Online, Heroes Evolved, Conquer Online, and Under Oath.

No other detail about the AI-powered CEO has been revealed so far, but the news has sparked a heated debate on social media about the issue of machines taking over humans’ jobs.
Interestingly, in 2017, popular Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma publicly stated, “In 30 years, a robot will likely be on the cover of Time magazine as the best CEO.”`,

    content: `DANCE FLOOR CONVERTS DANCERS' BODY HEAT INTO USABLE ENERGY   

         A trendy dance hall in Glasgow, Scotland, features an innovative dance floor that recycles energy from the body heat of dancers.

SWG3 hosts some of Glasgow’s largest dance parties, with thousands of people getting together to dance all night throughout the year. Starting this month, the dancers will not just be burning energy by busting moves but will also help keep it warm or cool, depending on the season. That is thanks to “Bodyheat,” an aptly-named dance floor that harnesses the body heat of dancers and recycles it.

The innovative system has been under development for three years and is a joint project of SWG3 and geothermal energy startup, TownRock Energy.

“When you start dancing at a medium pace, to the Rolling Stones, for example, you might be generating 250W of power,” David Townsend, founder of TownRock Energy, said. “But if you have a high-power DJ, absolutely slamming basslines and making everyone jump up and down, you could be generating 500-600W of thermal energy.”

TownRock Energy explained that Bodyheat works by capturing the heat generated by dancers, which is usually transferred into the dance hall, and pumping it into 12 underground spaces approximately 150m deep. The holes lead to a large underground rock cube that acts as a heat absorber, storing the energy so that, in cold weather, it can be used to supply hot water extra heat and to the venue. In hot weather, the system cools the dance hall’s atmosphere by sucking all the body heat from it.

Andrew Fleming-Brown, managing director of SWG3, admitted that a conventional heating or cooling system would have cost about 90 percent less than the £600,000 (USD$670,000) invested into Bodyheat, but he adds that the savings on energy bills make the investment recoverable in about five years.

“Trying to do an external geothermal well would have cost millions of pounds,” TownRock Energy’s David Townsend added. “Instead, we thought, why not collect the heat you already have from your customers and then use the ground to store it?”

If all goes according to plan, SWG3 estimates that the Bodyheat dance floor will help it get rid of its three gas-fired furnaces, reducing its annual carbon output by up to 70 metric tons. And all eyes are on SWG3 right now, because if the system proves a success here, there is no reason why it cannot be replicated somewhere else.

“If we can make it work here in this environment, there’s no reason why we can’t take it to other venues, not just here in Scotland and the UK, but also across Europe and farther away,” Mr. Fleming-Brown said.`,

Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni's son, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, issued a bizarre string of Tweets this week in which he offered to trade 100 cows for the right to marry Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and he threatened war if the "Romans" refused his offer.

"For my Italian friends, these are Nkore cows," the son wrote.  "The most beautiful cows on earth.   I know Europeans give girls that they like flowers.  I have never understood it.  In our culture, you give a girl that you like a cow.”

He wrote in a separate Tweet, that included a picture of Meloni: "I would give Giorgia 100 Nkore cows immediately!  For being fearless and true!"

The Ugandan king’s son continued his proposal with a threat: to go to war with Italy in the event that his offer of cows was refused.   He said, “If the Romans reject our cows, that means we must capture Rome.   But, that would take us days to do.”

The president's son continued his thoughts the next day, saying, "I think I have to start for Rome.   But, how do I get 100 cows through Customs?"

The king’s son has over 600,000 followers.   He is known in Africa as the "Tweeting General" because of his unusual social media habits and his military rank.

The Ugandan king formally apologized for other inappropriate comments his son had previously made, threatening to invade Kenya.  The king announced he was removing his son from command of the country's land forces.   However, he simultaneously promoted him to four-star general.  The king did not address his son's proposal to the Italian politician.

Until now, Italian Prime Minister Meloni does not appear to have replied to her would-be suitor or to his generous offer of farm animals.`,

    content: `COMPANY DESIGNS CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE FOR SPACE CELEBRATIONS
French champagne company G.H. Mumm has invested a lot of time and resources into developing a futuristic champagne bottle that can be used in space.

The Mumm Cordon Rouge Stellar is the first champagne designed specifically for space travel. It comes in a special half-glass bottle and features a newly-designed stainless steel opening/closing device that curves around the classic cork. The unique bottle features a finger-controlled valve which, when operated, releases a champagne sphere. Astronauts or space tourists can then scoop the drink out of the air, using special glasses that resemble tiny egg cups.

“This project is, of course, very stimulating because of its high-tech nature and its 100 percent French identity, from design to manufacturing,” designer Octave de Gaulle said. “But it is also very exciting because technology serves a greater purpose here: champagne brings back the memory of a place and a climate and of French savoir-faire and tastes for all those who will live far from Earth.”

Regular champagne bottles are not really fit for zero gravity. The champagne itself reacts differently under space conditions, because the bubbles do not rise to the surface. So, they do not release their aroma molecules as they do on Earth, thus changing the smell and first impression of the drink. In 2017, when the idea of commercial space travel started to become possible, G.H. Mumm decided to tackle all these issues.

After five years of research and collaborations with CNES (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales), the French government space agency, and with privately-funded American space company Axiom Space, the French champagne maker recently unveiled their Mumm Cordon Rouge Stellar.

“Imagine a crew in their capsule on their way to Mars for five months, whose members have not seen a fruit or vegetable since their departure and no longer in direct voice contact with Earth. They are confined to one or two rooms, sleep in sleeping bags hung on a wall. And one day, it is the birthday of one of them, or it is Christmas. How to mark this moment?” Octave de Gaulle asked. “With the champagne that we have developed, they will have a moment of happiness and humanity. It is not about drinking and drunkenness, but it is about recreating, up there, a favorite ceremony that we know on Earth.”

Apart from the futuristic bottle that comes in a protective shell, made of aircraft-grade aluminum, G.H. Mumm also created a very special champagne designed for enjoyment in zero gravity. The company's chief winemaker, Laurent Fresnet, aged the space wine in oak barrels and then kept the finished champagne bottles on their sides for five years.

The result of Fresnet's work is a bolder and spicier champagne with more aroma and acidity than the version of Mumm Cordon Rouge designed for earthly consumption. However, it is worth keeping in mind that these intense aromas and flavors will feel much less intense when experienced in outer space.

G.H Mumm has not currently put a price on its innovative Mumm Cordon Rouge Stellar champagne, but unless you're planning to travel into outer space anytime soon, you really should not buy it because it is designed for consumption in zero gravity, only.`,

An artist has gained international fame by recreating famous paintings using only meatloaf as his medium.

The artist, who goes by the name "Meatloaf Master," has recreated iconic works like the Mona Lisa, Starry Night, and The Scream using carefully shaped and colored meatloaf. Each piece takes weeks to create and must be preserved carefully to prevent spoilage.

The meatloaf paintings are created using different types of ground meat mixed with various spices and food coloring to achieve the right colors and textures. The artist uses special techniques to shape the meatloaf into the desired forms and patterns.

The works are displayed in temperature-controlled galleries to prevent them from going bad. Visitors are not allowed to touch the pieces, and photography is restricted to prevent damage from camera flashes.

The artist's work has sparked discussions about what constitutes art and whether food can be considered a legitimate artistic medium. Some art critics have praised his creativity and technical skill, while others question the practicality of creating art from perishable materials.

Despite the controversy, the Meatloaf Master's works have been exhibited in galleries around the world and have attracted thousands of visitors. Some of his pieces have sold for tens of thousands of dollars to private collectors.

The artist says he chose meatloaf as his medium because it represents the everyday and the extraordinary, showing that art can be found in the most unexpected places.`,

The "AutoShoes" feature tiny motors and sensors that allow them to move around on their own. The shoes can navigate obstacles, climb stairs, and even run at speeds of up to 10 kilometers per hour.

The technology was originally developed to help people with mobility issues, but the company has also created versions for entertainment and novelty purposes. The shoes can be programmed to follow their owner or move to specific locations.

Each shoe contains a small computer, battery, and multiple sensors that help it understand its environment. The shoes can communicate with each other and coordinate their movements to maintain balance.

The AutoShoes have become popular on social media, with videos of the shoes walking around by themselves going viral. Many people find the sight of shoes moving independently both fascinating and slightly creepy.

The company has also developed a smartphone app that allows users to control their shoes remotely. Users can make their shoes dance, walk in patterns, or even race against each other.

While the technology is impressive, some people have raised concerns about privacy and security, as the shoes could potentially be used for surveillance or tracking purposes.

The AutoShoes are currently available for pre-order at a price of $2,000 per pair, making them one of the most expensive shoes on the market.`,

A candy company has developed a new product that has absolutely no taste, designed for people who want to enjoy the texture of candy without the calories or flavor.

The "Tasteless Treats" come in various shapes and colors but contain no artificial flavors, sweeteners, or taste enhancers. The company claims that the candy provides the satisfying chewing experience without any taste sensation.

The product was originally developed for people with dietary restrictions or those trying to quit sugary snacks. However, it has unexpectedly become popular among food critics and taste testers who want to experience eating without flavor.

The candy is made from a special blend of natural ingredients that provide texture and mouthfeel without any taste. The company has spent years perfecting the formula to ensure the candy feels like real candy but tastes like nothing.

Some people have reported that eating the tasteless candy is a strange and almost meditative experience. They say it allows them to focus on the act of eating without being distracted by flavors.

The product has sparked discussions about the nature of taste and whether we can truly enjoy food without flavor. Some food scientists argue that texture and mouthfeel are just as important as taste in the eating experience.

The Tasteless Treats are available in limited quantities and have become a novelty item among food enthusiasts. The company plans to expand the product line to include different textures and shapes.

While some people find the concept bizarre, others see it as an innovative solution for people who want to enjoy the ritual of eating candy without the health concerns associated with sugary snacks.`,

The man, who wishes to remain anonymous, was eating a meal when he felt something hard in his mouth. Upon closer inspection, he discovered it was a bullet that he had accidentally swallowed two decades ago.

Medical experts say that it's extremely rare for a bullet to remain in the body for such a long time without causing serious health problems. They believe the bullet may have been lodged in the man's digestive tract and slowly moved through his system over the years.

The man recalled the incident from 20 years ago when he was cleaning a gun and accidentally swallowed a bullet. At the time, he didn't seek medical attention because he felt fine and assumed the bullet would pass naturally.

Doctors who examined the man after the bullet's reappearance found no signs of damage to his digestive system. They say the bullet's smooth surface may have prevented it from causing internal injuries.

The incident has sparked discussions about gun safety and the importance of seeking medical attention after accidents. Many people have been surprised to learn that such objects can remain in the body for extended periods.

The man has decided to keep the bullet as a reminder of his unusual experience. He says he plans to frame it and display it as a conversation piece in his home.

This extraordinary case has been documented in medical journals and has fascinated both medical professionals and the general public.`,
